### Known issue

Let's have set `Left Ctrl` as a joystick trigger and the `Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down` arrows for joystick moving in emulator.

Now if you **press and hold** `Left Ctrl` and concurrently **press** `Left Arrow` and `Down Arrow` or `Right Arrow` and `Down Arrow`, then moving to the left or right doesn't work on some keyboards. Also sometimes trigger is released though you didn't release it when having pressed such combination of keys.

#### Tested with the keyboards
* Dell KM5221W - affected
* Genius LuxePad 9100 and keyboard on NTB Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 14ARE05 - not affected
